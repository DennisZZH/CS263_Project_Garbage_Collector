# CS263_Project_Garbage_Collector
Survey and implementation of different garbage collector for a simple programing language L1

We would like to survey and implement several garbage collection techniques including reference counting, mark sweep, semi space and generational for a simple object oriented, c like language we design earlier called L1. If time permit, we would like to explore the possibility of applying these garbage collectors onto a distributed system.
